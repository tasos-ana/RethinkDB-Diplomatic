<p class="text-center text-secondary">
    Î™n the framework of my diplomatic work, I developed this application
    that allows me to send text and / or files
    between my devices by register and login on website.
    <br>The idea came from my need to send notes and files directly from my cell phone to my computer
    without having to always have a cable with me.
